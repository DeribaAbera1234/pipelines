# Short read alignment (vector) pipeline specification

* Version: 1.1.0
* Authors: Alistair Miles, Jim Stalker

This document specifies a protocol for alignment of short sequence
reads, intended for use with mosquito specimens individually sequenced
to high coverage (target ~30X) with paired-end sequencing on Illumina
machines.


## Assumptions

* The pipeline will be launched to align sequence reads from one or
  more samples as a batch.

* Any demultiplexing of multiple samples within a single sequencing
  lane will have been resolved upstream of this pipeline. I.e., the
  pipeline will run from demultiplexed sequence reads. The term
  "lanelet" is used here to mean data from a single lane of sequencing
  from a single sample.

* Each sample may have data from multiple sequencing runs (lanes), and
  the number of lanelets may vary between samples. I.e., the pipeline
  cannot assume a fixed number of lanelets per sample.

* The complete set of input data will be known ahead of time, before
  the pipeline is launched for a given batch of samples. I.e., there
  is no need to consider any case where additional lanelets may arrive
  at a later time.


## Inputs

* Reference sequence - The reference genome sequence to align to, in
  FASTA format.

* Sequence reads - One 

* Lanelet manifest - A tab delimited file with one row per lanelet.
