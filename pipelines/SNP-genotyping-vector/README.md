# SNPGenotyping (vector) pipeline

This folder contains the pipeline wdl and workflow inputs for the Vector SNP Genotyping pipeline as specified in https://github.com/malariagen/pipelines/blob/991b0328ea8027bc6b1137f893a5340e27c8e87c/docs/specs/snp-genotyping-vector.md

There are gcp and farm5-specific directories which contain versions specific to gcp (Google Cloud Platform) and farm5 (Sanger LSF) backed instances of cromwell.  For the wdl (pipelines) the ONLY differences are in the import statements.  For the example inputs the paths in those are specific to the platform in use.

The SNPGenotyping pipeline takes as input:
- sample_id: The Id/name of the sample to analyze
- output_base_name: The base filename that can be given to the outputs of the pipeline.  If not specified, the sample_id is used.
- input_bam: An aligned bam, as generated by the ShortReadAlignment pipeline
- input_bam_index: The index file of the aligned bam.
- alleles_vcf: The alleles VCF for use by the task UnifiedGenotyper
- alleles_vcf_index: The index file of the alleles VCF
- reference: A wdl structure containing Vector reference files
- runTimeSettings: A wdl structure containing run time settings.
