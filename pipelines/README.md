# pipeline code (WDL)

This folder contains high-level (pipeline workflows) code.  These are wdl files that 
are able to be run independently.  This will include workflows that can be run as
sub-workflows of other workflows.  Workflow files specific to specific platforms (e.g. farm5 or gcp)
are stored in files specific to that platform.
